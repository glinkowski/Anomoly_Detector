Original Parameters:
Scale = 1.05

Test 1

Scale = 0.95
OverlapThres = 0.35
Did not pick up people, mostly just their legs and things smaller than a normal person
Much faster - Took only a few parts

-----------------------------
Test 2

Scale = 1.10
OverlapThres = 0.35
Much slower.... had to cutoff after ~7 minutes
Seems to pick people up pretty well, overlapping people are done a lot better too
